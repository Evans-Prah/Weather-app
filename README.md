# Weather-app
This application is created with Node.js and handlebars template engine for the front-end. 
It fetches weather information from any location the user inputs. 
I used the weatherstack API to fetch current weather information.
With regards to the location, 
I used Mapbox API to fetch the longitude and latitude of the user input as location and pass it to the weatherstack API. 
Will be adding more functionality to this application.
